/**
 * Custom authentication strategy for the Negotiate logic required for SSO/Negotiate auth realm
 * {@link NegotiateAuthenticationRealm}. When the negotiate logic is executing, one of more round trips with the client
 * occur. When the {@link NegotiateAuthenticationRealm negotiate realm} determines another handshake is needed, it
 * throws the exception: {@link AuthenticationInProgressException}. This custom strategy detects this exception,
 * and immediately re-throws it so classes higher up in the call stack will allow the handshake to proceed.
 * Without this added logic, the handshake would be halted after the first connection by the existing error handling.
 * This strategy is needed when using {@link DynamicAuthenticationStrategy} and more than one realm is configured in
 * shiro.ini.
